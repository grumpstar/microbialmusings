Summary: Some tweaks here and some tweaks there, getting ready for opening.

Markdown is still not my favorite method of creation posts, and it's even sillier when I've got a fever, alas I will be replacing the french built into this theme and also playing around with my various synchronization options to get the workflow of creating new posts for this microblog down.

I have to also remember to turn off relative paths, an option that I thought would help but does not.

Here's my inserting one of the images of my current fancy. In hopes that it will work.
