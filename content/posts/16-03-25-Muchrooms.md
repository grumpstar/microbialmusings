Why do you think nobody ever randomly shows up at the job you lied to them about at a party where there was a giant psychedelic mushroom on a cutting board in the kitchen? 
Because nobody wants to show up at your job, it's a job, and they have job enough of their own. 
Besides you're probably not on your a-game mentally while your at your job and nobody who's interested in you wants to see you down.
