The problem I've found is the need for a place to let out little bursts of interesting thought
that aren't completely controlled and manipulated by various algorithms put in 
place by the big social networks. Why after all, in the sweet chili covered hell would
Facebook opt to show you my status updates, about scaring telemarketers away, when it
could be showing you a status update of one of the people that used three
brand hash tags in his posts because the three brands offered him a 2 percent
discount on his next order of toilet paper.

Facebook is  going to show you Bob "The Marketers Ideal Target" Smiths status update
8 out of 10 times. They keep the other two times open in there algorithm so the entirety of Facebook
doesn't come off as a complete corporate shill, but just a corporate shill,
which you can forgive it for being, because how else can you make money running
a website on the internet.

Then there is Twitter, I think Twitter is mostly popular because everyone and their wheelchair bound
grandmother is a citizen journalist, it certainly isn't popular because of an abundance of long
and vivid declaration of interesting thought processes or ideas. 140 Characters is great for comedians
~~TJ Hooker~~ ~~TJ Maxx~~ ~~TY Seagall~~ TJ Miller and also for citizen journalists, however trying to
get across anything deeper without linking to another page is covered in noise and not fully seen from the start anyway.

Tumblr can be a deep place, I've seen some people go into real rings around the processes of the mind, I'm talking a task manager dot exe
type audit of their own understanding of the world. It's mostly enthusiasts of fine "nude art" and anarchists though.

I am fairly certain that I remember snapchat starting off as a way for middle schoolers to share their bodies with one another and now has evolved into something that involves people making stories and essentially quelling their need for social interaction while at work by sharing their work lives with one another. Besides there is no writing on there. 

So I have decided to start many different places, all on the kove dot pw domain, one for small things, one for big things, another for art and so on and so forth
